# 30 Days Of Web Design Challenge

Welcome to the "30 Days Of Web Design" challenge! This repository is a collection of 30 unique web design projects, each created in a single day. This challenge is designed to help you improve your web design skills, explore creative concepts, and build a diverse portfolio of web design projects.

## How It Works

- **Day 1 to Day 30:** Every day for the next 30 days, design and build a new web project. Each day is an opportunity to explore different design concepts, experiment with layouts, and enhance your skills.

- **Daily Updates:** Share your daily progress and updates in this repository. Create a subdirectory for each day's project, and include relevant code, assets, and documentation.
